# Monitoring metrics
{: #monitoringÃŸ}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, such as {{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full_notm}}, generate platform metrics that you can use to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of the service in your account.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} is a third-party cloud-native, and container-intelligence management system that can be included as part of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} architecture. It offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers full-stack telemetry with advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts, and design custom dashboards. For more information, see [Monitoring in IBM Cloud](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-monitor).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}}, a platform service, to route platform metrics in your account to a destination of your choice by configuring targets and routes that define where platform metrics are sent. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-about).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} to visualize and alert on metrics that are generated in your account and routed by {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} to an {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance.

## Viewing metrics
{: #monitoring-view}

To view the metrics dashboards, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external} console.

    After you log in with your user ID and password, the IBM Cloud Dashboard opens.

2. Expand the left navigation window.

3. Click **Resource list**.

4. Click **Observability > Monitoring**.

    The list of instances that are available on IBM Cloud is displayed.

5. Click the instance.

6. Click **Open dashboard**. The IBM Cloud Monitoring dashboard opens.

7. Click **Dashboards > Dashboard Library > IBM** and select your dashboard to view.

To view metrics in your {{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full_notm}} dashboard, you must launch the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} web UI for the instance that is enabled for platform metrics in the region where your {{site.data.keyword.cephaas_short}} instance is provisioned.
