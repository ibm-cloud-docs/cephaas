# Service credentials
{: #sds-service-credentials-overview}


A service credential provides the information required to provide authentication for applications.

Service credentials are always associated with a Service ID, and new Service IDs can be created along with a new credential.

To view a credential, you must be granted the Administrator platform role or a custom role. For more information about this update, see the documentation.
