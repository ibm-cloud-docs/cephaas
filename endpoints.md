# IBM CephaaS endpoints
{: #endpoints}

Sending a REST API request or configuring a storage client requires setting a target endpoint or URL. Each storage location has its own set of URLs.

{{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full_notm}} is connected to a single network using **direct endpoints**.

**Direct endpoints** are used for requests originating from resources within {{site.data.keyword.cephaas_short}}. Like Private endpoints, Direct endpoints provide better performance over Public endpoints and do not incur charges for any outgoing or incoming bandwidth even if the traffic is cross regions or across data centers.
