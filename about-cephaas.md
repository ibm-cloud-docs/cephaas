# What is {{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full_notm}}?
{: #about-sds}

{{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full}} is a powerful software-defined enterprise storage platform that delivers a cloud-like experience on-premises with the convenience and flexibility of a pay-as-you-go model. Designed to provision storage in minutes, it enables self-provisioning of storage resources, allowing enterprises to quickly adapt to rapidly changing demands, breaking down the barriers of managing multiple dedicated Storage Systems.
{: shortdesc}

By eliminating over-provisioning and right-sizing your infrastructure, you can ensure optimal resource utilization and cost-efficiency. Based on the benefits of IBM Storage Ceph, it breaks down the silos of dedicated, proprietary storage infrastructure and software, offering unified support for multiple protocols across a single platform. With a seamless, single point of management, it simplifies operations, giving you control over your entire storage environment from one interface.


You can use APIs to interact with unified storage. {{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full_notm}} supports a subset of the S3 API for reading and writing data, as well as accounts configuration. Additionally, you can use the Resource Configuration API for reading and configuring bucket metadata.  A plug-in is available for the [{{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full_notm}} Command-Line Interface](/docs/cephaas?topic=cephaas-ic-sds-cli-reference#ic-sds-installation){: external}.

The [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external} provides a user interface for most operations and configuration as well.




Documentation on the best way to [get started](/docs/cephaas?topic=cephaas-getting-started) provides support for provisioning unified storage to create volumes and objects referencing common operations through CLI and API interactions.
