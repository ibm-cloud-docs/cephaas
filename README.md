# IBM Storage Ceph as a Service (CephaaS)

Documentation source repository for CephaaS deployment and configuration. Published at https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/cephaas.

## Creating content

Follow these steps to add to the cephaas deployment guide docs.

:information_source: **Tip:** If you'd rather give feedback about the documentation, create an [issue](https://github.ibm.com/cloud-docs/cephaas/issues).

### Before you begin

Set up your local development environment

- Visual Studio Code is the recommended editor. For more information, see [Choose an editor](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/writing?topic=writing-setting-up-your-markdown-environment#choose-an-editor).
- You can install a Markdown linter in Visual Studio Code that works with IBM Cloud docs. For more information, see [Integrating the Markdown linter in VS Code](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/writing?topic=writing-markdown-linter-vscode).

### Drafting content

All content starts from the `source` branch.

1.  Clone this repo if you have write privileges. Otherwise, fork the repo.
1.  Create a working branch from the `source` branch.
1.  Make your changes to the Markdown content.

    - Cloud docs uses Markdown with a few custom extensions to source the docs. For tips about how to structure and style your docs with IBM Cloud Markdown, see [Quick tips for authoring in IBM Cloud docs](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/writing?topic=writing-solution-guides#solution-guides-include-quick-tips) in "Creating solution, deployment, and migration guides".
    - Cloud docs also supports controlling content with tagging. For example, content within the <code>&lt;staging&gt;</code>&nbsp;<code>&lt;/staging&gt;</code> tags is not displayed to the public. For more information, see [Making updates to your docs](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/writing?topic=writing-update-docs).

1.  Commit your updates.
1.  Create a pull request from your branch or fork to `source`.

    1.  A Jenkins job runs that commits content to the `draft` and `review` branches and opens a pull request to the `publish` branch.
    1.  After a few minutes, you can see your changes in the IBM Cloud docs framework. Changes to `draft` are available at the internal `/docs-draft/` location (https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-draft/cephaas). Changes to `review` are available at the pre-production `/docs/` location (https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/cephaas).

:information_source: **Tip:** Content that is tagged with <code>&lt;draft&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;review&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;staging&gt;</code>, or feature tags are built and promoted only to the internal location and is not included in the pull request to the `publish` branch for production.

## Publishing to production

When content is committed to the `source` branch, a pull request is created from a branch called `next-prod-push` to the `publish` branch. So, changes can't go into the branch until they are reviewed, edited, and approved by a one of the doc maintainers.

The documentation team reviews your PR and might request changes.

- If the changes are relatively straightforward and self-contained, such as a corrected typographical error or a rewritten sentence, we will approve and merge them after issues are addressed.

- If the changes are more extensive, such as a significant rewrite or entirely new content, the documentation team might need to make revisions for editorial or style reasons.⁠ In this case, we might open a new PR against your branch with our proposed revisions.⁠ You can then review these revisions and incorporate the changes into your branch.⁠ After the documentation team is satisfied with the proposed changes, we merge your PR.⁠

When changes are merged to the `production` branch, they are built and published to production at https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cephaas.


### Guidelines for merging a PR

As someone with merge responsibilities, follow these guidelines and practices to make sure that changes are released consistently.


- Make sure that the merge commit message is clear and specific.

    :exclamation: **Important:** Do not expose IBM Confidential information in your commit message to `publish`. Commits made to the `publish` branch become public record. 

- Squash and merge

    - Use the **Squash and merge** option when you merge a PR. Status checks prevent the merge if the squash and merge method is not used. For more information, see [Squashing your merge commits](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/about-merge-methods-on-github#squashing-your-merge-commits).


## Monitoring

After a build is triggered by a commit or merge, you can monitor progress.


### Monitoring builds

The Slack channel [#docs-cephaas](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C071G4UPNA1) displays information about builds.


### Monitoring content quality

You can monitor the content quality on the Content Quality Dashboard (CQD): https://cops.console.test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-quality-dashboard. The CQD for docs content is updated daily For more information, see https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-internal/writing?topic=writing-cqd.
