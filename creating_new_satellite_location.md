Creating a satellite location is a mandatory step for preparing a new deployment. 

Prerequisite: A COS instance must already exist in your account before creating a new satellite. 

Perform the following steps for creating a new satellite location. 

1. On the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the **hamburger menu** > **Satellite** and select **Overview**.
2. You can see various information about Satellites such as Pricing, Tutorials, Locations, Connectors, Config, etc. 
3. Click **Create location** > **On-premises & edge**. 
4. Satellite location creation screen is displayed which allows you to fill your geographical details. 
5. Click **Add to estimate** to see the cost of your satellite. 
Depending on your IBM cloud billing, you may need to upgrade your balance to create a new satellite. 

Once a satellite location is created, it may take 30-45 minutes to become available.
