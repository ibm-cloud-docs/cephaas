{: #about-sds}

{{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full_notm}} is high performing, flexible, and predictable unified storage (block and object) on-premises, that is IBM managed with cloud-like provisioning capabilities and on-demand capacity.
{: shortdesc}



Developers use APIs to interact with their unified storage. {{site.data.keyword.cephaas_full_notm}} supports a subset of the S3 API for reading and writing data, as well as accounts configuration. Additionally, there is a Resource Configuration API for reading and configuring bucket metadata. Software development kits (SDKs) are available for the Python, Java, Go, and the Node.js framework. A plug-in is available for the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Command-Line Interface](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).

The [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external} provides a user interface for most operations and configuration as well.



## Next Steps
{: #about-sds-next-steps}

Documentation on the best way to [get started](/docs/sdsaas?topic=sdsaas-getting-started) provides support to provision unified storage to create volumes and objects, and to use a reference of common operations through CLI and API interactions.
